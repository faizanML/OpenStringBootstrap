# OpenStringBootstrap
Package implements non-linear, constrained, optimization using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to bootstrap the open string amplitude by imposing unitarity, analyticity and crossing symmetry constraints. For more details, read the paper: [Bootstrapping string models
with entanglement minimization
